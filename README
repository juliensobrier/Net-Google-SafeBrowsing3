Net-Google-SafeBrowsing3
========================


This library is obsolete. Google Safe Browsinv v3 has been shult down by Google. Use v4 at http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net%3A%3AGoogle%3A%3ASafeBrowsing4

Net::Google::SafeBrowsing2::Lookup implements the Google Safe Browsing v2 Lookup API (up to 10,000 URL checks a day).

The library passes most of the unit tests listed in the API documentation. 

The Google Safe Browsing database must be stored and managed locally.
Net::Google::SafeBrowsing3::Sqlite uses Sqlite as the storage back-end, Net::Google::SafeBrowsing3::MySQL uses MySQL.
Other storage mechanisms (databases, memory, etc.) can be added and used transparently with this module.


The source code is available on github at https://github.com/juliensobrier/Net-Google-SafeBrowsing3.
